The project demonstrates usage of Spring, MVC structure, including service 
and repository classes, validator, SQL, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Thymeleaf,
HTML. The project represents itself as a modified accounting system in a library,
where users of the library are registered and books are assigned to the users.

Artifact deployment using Tomcat v.9 should be set before running the server.

Full description in progress, yet...
